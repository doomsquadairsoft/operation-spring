# Operation: Green Fox III


The third installment of an airsoft game put on by Doomsquadairsoft in spring.


## Event Description

Scheduled during Spring Break, this should have a good turnout, and be a great first game of 2017! This game has had loads of planning and will feature special player classes, pyrotechnics and special equipment.


## Event Goal

The goal for this event is for everyone to have a fun, immersive airsoft experience. To that end, let's focus on creating a solid game concept using Controlpointer, and not get too deep into creating custom game rules that are hard to learn in a briefing.

A backstory will complement the gameplay, but shouldn't be the focus.

TL:DR; Keep it simple.


## Prizes

* CB Hat
* dump pouch


## Story

REDFOR vs. BLUFOR.

BLUFOR is from Bluunia,  REDFOR is from Reddskad.

*IDEA* A rare exotic resource is discovered in Bluunia. Reddskad becomes greedy and invades to claim the exotic resource for themselves.

### Briefing

*Idea* After initial briefing, each team captain gets a briefing to read aloud to their team. The briefings contain orders unique to their team.

The year is 2020. The scientific community is baffled as a rare, exotic material dubbed DOOMium has mysteriously appeared throughout Bluunia. Enticed by the idea of weaponizing the material and becoming a global superpower, the country of Reddskad sends an invasion force to occupy Bluunia and collect the rare material.

#### BLUFOR Briefing

BLUFOR spies have tipped us off that REDFOR is about to invade. Our mission is to locate all DOOMium within Bluunia, and protect it from coming under control of REDFOR.


#### REDFOR Briefing

DOOMium is an exotic resource with value we can only imagine. DOOMium can only be found in Bluunia, yet it's imperitive that Reddskad inherits the resource. Our mission is simple. Invade Bluunia, find the DOOMium, and capture it for our king.


### Setup

The field is Bluunia. The staging area is Reddskad. Place signage to indicate this.

(x4) D3VICE 2B are placed on the field (Bluunia), each in positions unknown to either team. The game begins with BLUFOR able to roam the field and search for the DOOMium. After a short period, REDFOR is inserted into Bluunia to find DOOMium and/or engage BLUFOR.



#### Signage

"Welcome to Bluunia"

"DANGER! DOOMIUM CONTAMINATED AREA. KEEP OUT."

"Reddskadders go home! Reddskadders not welcome!"


### Class-Based Combat

Just like many FPS games, where players operate as a type of combatent with specific traits, there are four classes in Operation: Green Fox. The Grenadier carries a high-output smoke grenade and a frag grenade. The Medic can get their teammates back in the fight without having to walk back to a respawn. The Sapper can instantly dismantle enemy control points, and the Captain can quickly claim uncaptured control points. The Assault class is a rifleman with a small smoke grenade.


### Prizes

All participants in this event will be entered to win one of several raffle prizes! Airsoft Innovations Cyclone grenade, Tokyo Marui XL Speed Loader, and more! Special prizes will be awarded to most valuable players voted by each team.

#### Safety & Rules

Our number one focus for today is safety, because it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt.


  * Do not blind fire. Blind firing is any time you are shooting and are not clearly looking down your gun. There is one exception for if you are using a gun camera :)
  * Max FPS on all airsoft guns is 400 FPS for all players, or 550 FPS for players holding Spokane Airsoft sniper cards (or equivalent safety certification.)
  * Eye protection must be ANZI 87 certified and be worn at all times on the field.
  * Mouth guards and ear protectors are suggested.
  * Safe zones are the staging area and parking lot.
    * This is very important for everyone's safety, since there are people without eye protection in safe zones, I will bark at you if I see live guns.
    * No test firing in the safe zone
    * Mags out, guns clear, safetys on in the safe zone.
  * Minimum engagement with AEGs and Pistols is 15 feet.
  * Minimum engagement with all guns above 400 FPS is 50 feet.
  * Do not shoot full auto at close range.
  * Do not misrepresent your dead/down/alive status. (no playing dead)
  * Dead men do not talk.
  * Do not use dead players, referees, or spectators as human shields.
  * All body hits count. Gear hits count. Riccochets do not count. Gun hits only count if the BB would pass through the gun and hit your body or gear.
  * Do not attempt to use hopup to shoot around corners.
  * Avoid headshots. Aim center mass when possible.
  * Use safety kills. Safety kill can only be called when you have the upper hand.
  * No bang-bangs. Engage safely, use a safety kill, parlay, or 1 for 1.
  * Rubber knife kills are allowed using a gentle tap, not a stab.
  * Riot shields are allowed only for the assault class while wielding a pistol.
  * Do not call other player's hits. If you notice a player not calling their hits, please tell either Chris or Russell.
  * Grenades and other explosive have a 20 foot kill radius unless obstructed by a solid object. When in doubt, think, "If that were a real grenade, would I have been hit by it?"

Airsoft relies heavily on the honor system, so please be respectful and engage safely. Remember the golden rule.


Questions? Ask Russell and I at any time if you have any questions.
