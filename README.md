# Operation: Blooming Fox


An Airsoft game put on by Doomsquadairsoft in spring 2017.


## Event Description

Scheduled during Spring Break, this should have a good turnout, and be a great first game of 2017! This game has had loads of planning and will feature special player classes, pyrotechnics and special equipment.


### REDFOR vs. BLUFOR

Chris has created an electronic control point solution, similar to our "Domination" device which we have used during night games. Each control point will have a stationary device which players can interact with. The device can be set to either team, REDFOR or BLUEFOR, and the status of each control point on the field can be seen by viewing a website on any player's smartphone. Players can respawn at any point controlled by their team.


### Class-Based Combat

Just like many FPS games, where players operate as a type of combatent with specific traits, there are four classes in Operation: Green Fox. The Grenadier carries a high-output smoke grenade and a frag grenade. The Medic can get their teammates back in the fight without having to walk back to a respawn. The Sapper can instantly dismantle enemy control points, and the Captain can quickly claim uncaptured control points. The Assault class is a rifleman with a small smoke grenade.


### Prizes

All participants in this event will be entered to win one of several raffle prizes! Airsoft Innovations Cyclone grenade, Tokyo Marui XL Speed Loader, and more! Special prizes will be awarded to most valuable players voted by each team.
