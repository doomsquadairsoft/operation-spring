# Operation: Blooming Fox


An Airsoft game put on by Doomsquadairsoft in spring 2017.


## Event Description

Scheduled during Spring Break, this should have a good turnout, and be a great first game of 2017! This game has had loads of planning and will feature special player classes, pyrotechnics and special equipment.


### REDFOR vs. BLUFOR

Chris has created an electronic control point solution, similar to our "Domination" device which we have used during night games. Each control point will have a stationary device which players can interact with. The device can be set to either team, REDFOR or BLUEFOR, and the status of each control point on the field can be seen by viewing a website on any player's smartphone. Players can respawn at any point controlled by their team.


### Class-Based Combat

Just like many FPS games, where players operate as a type of combatent with specific traits, there are four classes in Operation: Green Fox. The Grenadier carries a high-output smoke grenade and a frag grenade. The Medic can get their teammates back in the fight without having to walk back to a respawn. The Sapper can instantly dismantle enemy control points, and the Captain can quickly claim uncaptured control points. The Assault class is a rifleman with a small smoke grenade.


### Prizes

All participants in this event will be entered to win one of several raffle prizes! Airsoft Innovations Cyclone grenade, Tokyo Marui XL Speed Loader, and more! Special prizes will be awarded to most valuable players voted by each team.

### Briefing


#### Introductions

Is everyone ready for some airsoft? (listen and get feel)

I'd like to start with some introductions, so we're all shooting at friends rather than shooting at strangers (I think it's more fun that way). If we could go around the circle and get everyone's name, an airsoft callsign if they have one, and how long they've been playing airsoft, I think that's a good place to start.

Thank you for coming to Operation: Green Fox. I'm really excited to have you here today for DooM Squad Airsoft's first game of the year. 


#### Safety & Rules

Our number one focus for today is safety, because it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt.


  * Do not blind fire. Blind firing is any time you are shooting and are not clearly looking down your gun. There is one exception for if you are using a gun camera :)
  * Max FPS on all airsoft guns is 400 FPS for all players, or 550 FPS for players holding Spokane Airsoft sniper cards (or equivalent safety certification.)
  * Eye protection must be ANZI 87 certified and be worn at all times on the field.
  * Mouth guards and ear protectors are suggested.
  * Safe zones are the staging area and parking lot.
    * This is very important for everyone's safety, since there are people without eye protection in safe zones, I will bark at you if I see live guns.
    * No test firing in the safe zone
    * Mags out, guns clear, safetys on in the safe zone.
  * Minimum engagement with AEGs and Pistols is 15 feet.
  * Minimum engagement with all guns above 400 FPS is 50 feet.
  * Do not shoot full auto at close range.
  * Do not misrepresent your dead/down/alive status. (no playing dead)
  * Dead men do not talk.
  * Do not use dead players, referees, or spectators as human shields.
  * All body hits count. Gear hits count. Riccochets do not count. Gun hits only count if the BB would pass through the gun and hit your body or gear.
  * Do not attempt to use hopup to shoot around corners.
  * Avoid headshots. Aim center mass when possible.
  * Use safety kills. Safety kill can only be called when you have the upper hand.
  * No bang-bangs. Engage safely, use a safety kill, parlay, or 1 for 1.
  * Rubber knife kills are allowed using a gentle tap, not a stab.
  * Riot shields are allowed only for the assault class while wielding a pistol.
  * Do not call other player's hits. If you notice a player not calling their hits, please tell either Chris or Russell.
  * Grenades and other explosive have a 20 foot kill radius unless obstructed by a solid object. When in doubt, think, "If that were a real grenade, would I have been hit by it?"

Airsoft relies heavily on the honor system, so please be respectful and engage safely. Remember the golden rule.


Questions? Ask Russell and I at any time if you have any questions.


#### Gameplay

This is a team focused, class-based combat game which uses a computerized capture point system to keep score. Today we have two games planned, each lasting up to two ours, with no breaks. Obviously if you need to take a break, please do so by exiting the field and coming to the staging zone. Remember mags out, guns clear, safeties on in the safezone.

This game is REDFOR vs. BLUFOR. Each team has a variety of classes. One captain, one medic, one sapper, one grenadier, and any number of assaults. Each class has unique abilities which can be used to help your team, or hinder the opposing team.

There are four control points today. Goblin Fortress, King's Tower, Troll Bridge, and Swamp City. Each team starts with one control point, marked with a virtual flag in their team's color. There remain two grey flags on the map, which either team can claim. When a player dies, they can respawn at any control point owned by their team. Here's the live game map (show map.) As control points are captured, the map will update on your phone to show you the live status. You can respawn at any solid bordered control point. If a control point has a dashed border, it is contested by the opposing team and you cannot spawn at it.

Control points owned by an enemy are converted to your team's color in two stages, dismantling and capturing. The first stage is dismantling, this is where you must turn the opponent team's flag color into grey. Second stage is capturing, this is where you turn a grey flag into your own team's color.

Any player class can capture or dismantle a control point, but certain player classes can do one or the other twice as fast.

In Operation: Green Fox, the hit rules are a little different than most airsoft games. When you are hit, call "HIT!" three times, raise your arms, place your dead-rag on your head, and sit on the ground where you were hit. You are not dead yet, you are just [downed]. You remain [down] for thirty seconds, so start counting out loud. If you aren't [healed] within 30 seconds, you [bleed out], and are [dead], then you can walk back to a respawn. A captain can use [self-heal] to save themselves from [bleeding out], but only after being down for 30 seconds.

The Captain is an important class, focused on helping their team succeed. Their abilities are [Self-heal], which lets them heal themself instead of [bleeding out] and having to walk back to respawn. The captain's second ability is [Claim], which lets them turn grey flags into their team's color flags in half the time as other players.

The Medic is essential to a team's well being. The medic heals downed players so they don't have to walk back to a respawn. A medic cannot heal themselves.

The Sapper is well versed in destroying things who can help your team capture enemy control points. Their special ability is [Sabotage], which lets them turn the enemy's color flag into a grey flag in half the time as other players.

I'll start by introducing the player ID cards. These cards will be printed out at the start of each game, and they will you about your in-game identity. This game is REDFOR vs. BLUFOR and here I have the ID card for Ronald Ronaldsen who is on team BLU. Ronald is a Medic,
