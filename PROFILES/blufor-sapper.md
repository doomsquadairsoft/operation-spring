# You are a sapper

As a child, you blew up the neighbor's mailbox with a cluster of M80s. In science class, when you weren't busy unscrewing the teacher's chair, all you were interested in was how to create contact explosives. Your unquenchable urge to destroy things leads you to knock over every sand castle you've ever laid eyes on.

You were a perfect fit to serve BLUFOR as a Sapper. While on undercover operations during said service, you may or may not have been responsible for the destruction of the St. Heraldo Monastery, Amsterdun Suspension Bridge, and Delfix Airport.
