Hello I am Chris with DooM Squad Airsoft in Spokane, Washington, USA. (doomsquadairsoft.com) 

We have an upcoming airsoft operation this spring, and I was wondering if you had available any Evike swag that we could give out to the event participants, as handouts or as prizes. We always have new players and it would be great to be able to hook them up with something like stickers or patches and point them in the direction of my favorite airsoft store.

Given our event history, we anticipate no more than 20 attendees. If you had any items available, we would really appreciate it. Thanks and have a great day.
